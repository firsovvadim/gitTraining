As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\
I take a look at my life and realize there's not much left\
'Coz I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that\
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone\
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it\
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of\
You better watch how you're talkin', and where you're walkin'\
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk\
I really hate to trip but I gotta, loc\
As I grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool\
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like\
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives,
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives,
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' mostâ€¦
